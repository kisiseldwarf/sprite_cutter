# Sprite Cutter

Sprite Cutter is a binary made to help primarily game creators to cut sprite sheet into a certain amount of sprites.
It is meant to be very simple to use.

# How to use

Use `make install` in the current directory.

Then, use the binary as follows :

`./sprite_cutter [Source sheet] [Sprite size]`

The source sheet is the sprite sheet to cut from. (jpg or png).

The Sprite size is the wanted size of the sprites at the end. (in pixels, and usually a power of 2 like 32, 64 or 128).
